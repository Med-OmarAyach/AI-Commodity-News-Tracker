U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that China had increased its target for U.S. soybean purchases, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture in a monthly world crop report on Tuesday said, “China is reported to be considering buying more U.S. soybeans.” Brazil, the world’s biggest soy producer and exporter, has begun harvesting a record-large soybean crop that is expected to dominate the global export market in the coming months. But the prospect of China buying additional U.S. soy cargoes under a trade truce has buoyed the futures market. “The big unknown with China continues to be the big factor. We are finding that futures are just not able to set back very much in this environment,” said Terry Linn, analyst with Linn & Associates in Chicago. Wheat climbed despite a lack of news. Commodity funds hold a hefty net short position in CBOT wheat futures, leaving the market vulnerable to bouts of short-covering. Corn futures drifted lower, losing to soybeans and wheat on inter-market spreads.

Canola yields were from 45 to 60 bu./ac. as swathing and desiccation were ongoing. Flax was in the brown capsule stage and most sunflowers have completed flowering. Avian Control, a bird repellent, received emergency registration in sunflowers to reduce damage by blackbirds. However, the treatment, which can be applied up to the day of harvest, can cause damage such as leaf discolouration. ADVERTISEMENT Field pea yields ranged from 30 to 75 bu./ac., averaging approximately 60 bu./ac. Dry beans were in the R7 and R8 stages, while most soybeans were in the R5 and R6 stages. Warm weather and improved moisture conditions in some areas allowed pastures to regrow, providing extra grazing days for livestock. Second cut harvest yields for beef producers were below-average and dairies were on their third cut, which were seeing higher yields than the second cut. Slough hay and straw yields appeared to be average. Silage corn harvest is set to begin in two weeks as most corn were in the dent stage. Cattle on pasture were in good condition while producers monitor for foot rot, fly pressure and pneumonia. Water levels were mixed, causing some producers to move cattle or haul water. Winter feed supplies were also mixed with some producers sourcing additional feed and others with a surplus selling their own. ","Fall rye, winter wheat near completion","Crop Management,Weather"

The show and Prairie Clean Enterprises announced the deal as the 2025 show wound down last month. Follow all our coverage of Agribition here ADVERTISEMENT Read Also Deere expands spot spray for small grains crops John Deere says it has expanded the See and Spray system’s functionality to other crops. For the 2027 model year machines, it will be compatible with wheat, barley and canola. PCE is a Regina-based company that has just commissioned its flax straw processing facility in Weyburn, Sask. Mark Cooper, president and chief executive officer, said this will require a “tremendous” amount of bedding. “We will be working with Agribition and with the exhibitors to work through the specific needs of each animal breed and what’s necessary for each exhibitor, but we’re going to have it available,” he said. Why it Matters: Flax straw is often seen as waste and burned, rather than turned into a useful product. Cooper said Agribition will showcase a Saskatchewan-made product, the first of its kind in the world. The company in 2024 developed a patent-pending decortication process that removes the fibre from the shive more efficiently, it said. The process is faster and uses less energy. PCE has four product lines: Flax fibre for sustainable pulp, paper, packaging and biomaterials. Biomass and pellets for low-carbon heat and power sources. Premium cat litter;. Low-dust animal bedding. Cooper said offering a product that produces less dust means healthier animals and people. “It absorbs the ammonia so the barns smell better than with any other product you’d find,” he said. PCE is located in the former distillery and ethanol plant just outside Weyburn. Cooper said they were able to install their equipment and ready the building within six months. “We have customers ready and waiting both in Europe and in North America for both the pellets and the fibre,” he said. At Agribition, farmers were able to see the products and compare them to wood shavings, and Cooper said more and more are interested in selling straw. ADVERTISEMENT He added he believes the time is right for a flax plant. Saskatchewan has seen several ventures come and go over the years. “The world has changed so tremendously in the last decade,” he said. “We hear all the time about how Saskatchewan has what the world needs, right? Food, fuel and fertilizer. There’s another F to add to that, and that’s fibre, and that’s flax fibre specifically.” ",N/A,"Crop Management,Livestock Management,News"

The average yield in Saskatchewan was about 27 bushels per acre, much higher than the 10 year average of 22 bu. There isn’t one reason for yields in the high 20s and 30s this year, but it’s a safe bet that the cool summer played a role. In Saskatoon, only one day in July had a daytime high that exceeded 30 C. ADVERTISEMENT Read Also Deere expands spot spray for small grains crops John Deere says it has expanded the See and Spray system’s functionality to other crops. For the 2027 model year machines, it will be compatible with wheat, barley and canola. In previous years, with hotter summers, researchers from the University of Saskatchewan learned that flax doesn’t tolerate 33 C temperatures during flowering. Bunyamin Tar’an, a flax and chickpea breeder from the University of Saskatchewan, found this out when he grew flax under irrigation at the university. Even when sufficient water was available, flax plants could not withstand the summertime heat. “When the temperature hits 30 to 32 degrees during flowering… there was no shortage of moisture… but the yield drops,” he said. “When I looked at the bolls of flax, there (were) no seeds. This is the effect of the heat stress. A lot of seeds are aborted inside the bolls.” Tar’an has been the flax breeder at the U of S since 2021, so he hasn’t had a lot of time to improve the heat tolerance and yield potential of new flax varieties. The data clearly shows that flax yields have been “stagnant” for the last couple of decades, Tar’an said. ADVERTISEMENT Using Statistics Canada data: Average flax yields were slightly more than 20 bu. in 2005-10. Fifteen to 20 years later, yields had crept up to 23-25 bu. per acre. Over the last 30 years, the yield gain in flax is only 9.6 pounds per acre per year, Tar’an said. That sounds worse when compared to canola, which has gained 52 lb. per acre per year. To push flax higher, Tar’an and his colleagues are screening existing flax varieties and a broad germplasm, seeking genes and traits that could improve the oilseed’s heat tolerance. It’s part of a four year project, supported by the Saskatchewan Agriculture Development Fund, the Manitoba Crop Alliance and SaskOilseeds. ADVERTISEMENT So far in the project, there is good news and bad. The good is that some flax materials, including wild varieties, are more tolerant of high temperatures, Tar’an said. The bad? Commercial flax varieties in Canada are sensitive to high temperatures in the summer. It will take years for Tar’an to identify and understand the processes within flax that provide protection against 32 C days and warm nights during the bloom period. Then, he will integrate that improved tolerance into a flax variety that has high quality oil in the seed and other desirable traits. This process would be faster if Tar’an had more help.

Cash prices for flax across Western Canada ranged from C$13.91 to C$16.48 per bushel delivered as of Jan. 15, reported Prairie Ag Hotwire. That compares with canola bids of C$13.65 to C$14.01/bu.

However, Shield said “it could affect flax pricing for next year.” Flax plantings With Prairie farmers making their plans for spring seeding, Shiels said it’s likely flax acres will increase in 2026/27. In 2025/26, more than 620,000 acres of flax went into the ground, up from about 504,000 in 2024/25, according to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada . That produced 454,000 tonnes of flax this fall compared to 258,000 the previous year due in part to a stronger yield. Farmers need premium ADVERTISEMENT However, Shiels cautioned that any increase in canola prices don’t necessarily guarantee higher prices for flax. “If canola rallies to $16/bu. then $16 flax isn’t good anymore,” he said. “We tend to want to see a couple of bucks per bushel premium compared to the canola market to get that flax into the ground.” Shiels said Canada needs to grow more flax as to cut down on the amount imported. AAFC estimated 8,000 tonnes were brought in during 2024/25 and that increased to 10,000 tonnes in 2025/26. “I’d rather see our Prairie farmers reaping the benefits from that,” he said.

A project at the Manitoba Crop Diversification Centre (MCDC) in Carberry is testing two seed treatment options at different rates on yellow and brown flax varieties, focusing on helping crops establish strong stands rather than controlling specific diseases. “I’m more concerned about the benefits of a seed treatment for getting the profit of the ground, having a little bit of strength so that can grow to have a strong plant,” Morgan Cott, agronomy extension specialist for special crops with Manitoba Crop Alliance , said at an MCDC field day earlier this summer. ADVERTISEMENT Read Also Deere expands spot spray for small grains crops John Deere says it has expanded the See and Spray system’s functionality to other crops. For the 2027 model year machines, it will be compatible with wheat, barley and canola. The stidu addresses a gap identified by producers who questioned why little flax seed treatment research was being conducted in Manitoba. The study examines not just emergence and disease control but also the “treatability” of flax seed itself, Cott said. Farmers don’t typically like to treat flax because they feel like it runs right off due to the seed’s shiny, waxy coating, which makes it difficult for treatments to adhere properly, Cott said. The trial is testing seed treatments targeting three main seedling diseases that affect flax: fusarium, rhizoctonia and pythium. These diseases affect flax, as they do most crops, making prevention through seed treatments or other management practices important, Cott said. Fusarium, while present in Manitoba soil and affecting cereals, oilseeds and pulses, tends to be a weaker root rot in flax compared to other crops. However, it can cause fusarium wilt later in the plant’s development rather than just root rotting issues in seedlings. “It’ll affect the plant at any age. So, when we’re scouting for it in seedlings, we’re going to be pulling up those flax plants and finding like an ashy gray root colour,” Cott said, adding that in more mature plants, the tip turns yellow and the condition moves down the plant. Rhizoctonia represents a bigger concern, particularly given its prevalence in pulse crops. The disease can affect plants before, during and after emergence, causing lesions at or below the soil surface that can kill smaller plants, but which larger plants may grow out of as they become stronger, Cott said. She said pythium thrives in wet conditions and saturated, cool soil conditions. Unlike some diseases, it doesn’t need a wound to infect the plant and causes browning and discoloration of roots along with stunted plant growth. ADVERTISEMENT The research is using either Insure Pulse or Vitaflo products at high and low application rates on two varieties: AAC Bright, a yellow-seeded variety, and CDC Rowland, a brown-seeded variety. Cott has noticed visible differences between treated and untreated plots in her research. In one comparison, untreated AAC Bright was still flowering while treated plants in the adjacent plot had progressed further in development, suggesting the treatment may have prevented delayed emergence rather than necessarily controlling disease. “My takeaway is not that there was necessarily disease here. There could have been, but it was probably delayed and emerging a little bit. Not that I’m trying to sell seed treatment, but it did work,” Cott said. CDC Rowland appeared to be a stronger plant compared to AAC Bright in the trials, she added. Beyond disease control and emergence benefits, the research examines how well seed treatment products adhere to and flow with flax seed during planting operations. The seed’s waxy coating creates challenges for both treatment application and seed flow through planting equipment. For producers who do choose to treat flax seed, best practices have been developed to improve results, Cott said. “A seed treater would typically encourage a farmer to treat it and then leave it for a few days to let it really not solidify, but get firm on the seed and then flowability is better.” ADVERTISEMENT The recommended practice involves treating the seed and then letting it sit for about a week before planting to improve flow characteristics and reduce bridging issues with the small seeds, Cott added. The research is being conducted at all four diversification centres in Manitoba, providing 12 site-years of data when the study concludes this year. However, Cott doesn’t expect to see major disease control or yield boost benefits from the treatments. “I typically don’t think you’re going to be seeing too much for disease control or yield boost. It’s more, as I say, about getting the crop out of the ground,” she said. ",Researchers are investigating whether seed treatment products can improve crop emergence and plant stands,Crop Management

Brandon Motz, owner and manager of CorNine Commodities in Lacombe, Alta., said prices for feed barley rose to C$270 to C$272 per tonne delivered in Lethbridge as of Jan. 19, compared to C$260 to C$265 in the previous week. He added that recent strong sales have lifted prices at the right time. “Barley needs at the feedlots still remain lower. Demand is not super high on the feedlot side. It’s allowed exports to come in and pick up some of that slack on the barley side,” Motz said. “We expect export demand to remain for the next several weeks, in terms to being able to post a competitive bid. Unless more business gets put on and it might last a bit longer.” ADVERTISEMENT Read Also Feed Grain Weekly: Corn affecting barley prices in Lethbridge Corn imports entering Lethbridge have lowered prices for feed barley compared to those in Edmonton. He added that export demand for feed grains is not abnormal for this time of year and that much of the feed barley exported is going to Japan. Meanwhile, a large corn crop in the United States is making corn imports more appealing to buyers, but prices are still not at parity with feed barley. ADVERTISEMENT “Corn (prices in) Lethbridge would be barley’s ceiling. Not everybody want to feed with corn, but corn is C$280 to C$283 in Lethbridge,” Motz said. “There are still guys that are feeding corn, but for the most part, barley is still the main source for feed today. If barley starts to run away, corn will become the default … From a dollars and cents perspective, it would be an easy switch.” Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada released its January principal field crops outlook on Jan. 21, which included initial projections for the 2026-27 crop year. Seeded area for barley is set to increase by six per cent at 2.635 million hectares, but a return to average yields will see production decline by 13.1 per cent at 8.45 million tonnes. Prairie Ag Hotwire reported delivered feed barley prices in Alberta ranged from C$4.50 to C$5.88 per bushel as of Jan. 21, steady from the past month. In Saskatchewan, prices were from C$4.50 to C$4.90/bu. (up 15 cents from the past month) and in Manitoba, prices were C$4.50 to C$4.64/bu. (up 11 cents). For feed wheat, delivered prices in Alberta ranged from C$5.85 to C$7.48/bu. (down 14 cents). In Saskatchewan, a bid of C$6.88 was reported (steady) and in Manitoba, C$5.82 was reported (up 13 cents). ",N/A,"Crop Management,Markets"

Susanne Leclerc of Market Master Ltd. in Edmonton said there is a wide gap between March prices in Edmonton and Lethbridge due to the amount of corn coming into the southern half of the province. However, the discrepancy is narrowing for April delivery. “Elevators are paying C$5.70 (per bushel for feed barley) delivered in the Edmonton region, and when you take the feed barley price picked up in the Lethbridge region, it would only be C$5.10, C$5.15 in the March timeframe picked up in the yard,” Leclerc explained.

So it will be interesting to see if they get closer or not, because there is more corn coming into the Lethbridge area.” Strong export programs at elevators for feed barley are keeping prices elevated, she added, diminishing the grain’s market advantage over corn. Leclerc also said mild weather and higher prices have resulted in increased grain movement. More markets coverage : World’s winter wheat crops look good for now “More people are taking advantage of the markets that are there,” she said. ADVERTISEMENT Other grains are also making their way into feedlots to fulfill their feed ratios. “We’re seeing some more wheat being picked up by feedlots,” Leclerc said. “We’re seeing more demand for feed pulses like feed peas and fabas. There is still a lot of demand for feed oats.” Feed grain prices should start to see their perennial spring rallies at around April, she added. Delivered feed barley prices in Alberta ranged from C$4.90 to C$5.88/bu., down four cents from the previous week, said Prairie Ag Hotwire on Feb. 11. Those in Manitoba were from C$4.60 to C$4.61, down two cents, while a price of C$5.00 was reported in Saskatchewan, unchanged from the week before. For feed wheat, delivered prices in Alberta ranged from C$6.31 to C$7.59/bu., down three cents from seven days earlier.

For winter soft wheat, France’s main cereal crop , the ministry now expects the 2026 area to reach 4.59 million hectares (11.3 million acres), up slightly from its initial projection of 4.56 million in December, it said on Tuesday.

That was now eight per cent above the 2025 area and 11.6 per cent above the five-year average. Analysts have anticipated an increase in rapeseed planting in France and across Europe given more favourable prices than for cereals, as well as strong yields in last summer’s harvest. Favourable autumn weather had also raised expectations that the soft wheat area would hold steady, despite falling prices. ADVERTISEMENT Among other winter crops, the ministry pegged the 2026 winter barley area at 1.26 million hectares (3.11 million acres), compared to 1.23 million previously and up 5.3 per cent on the year. For winter durum wheat, however, the estimated 2026 area was reduced slightly, to 196,000 hectares (484,327 acres) from 199,000 forecast in December. That left the projected area marginally below last year’s level and nearly 16 per cent below the five-year average. Wheat and rapeseed are almost entirely sown as winter crops in France, whereas barley production includes a significant portion of spring-grown crop.

Soybeans rose despite bearish data in the USDA’s monthly supply-demand report. The agency raised its estimate of soybean production in Brazil, the world’s top supplier of the oilseed, to 180 million metric tons, up from its previous estimate of 178 million and above an average of analyst estimates for 179.39 million. The USDA left its forecast of U.S. soybean stocks remaining at the end of the current marketing year unchanged at 350 million bushels. Some brokers remain optimistic that U.S. soybean exports will increase, potentially tightening end-year inventories, in light of U.S. President Donald Trump’s remark last week that China had increased its target for U.S. soybean purchases under a trade truce. “China is reported to be considering buying more U.S. soybeans,” the USDA said in the text of its report. “They (traders) believe that the ending stocks are going to come down, from the administration trying to be pro-demand from China,” said Don Roose, president of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities. Meanwhile, CBOT soyoil futures hit contract highs across the board, buoyed this week by optimism about demand from the biofuels sector as well as a U.S.-India trade pact that could spur export business. Corn and wheat futures sputtered, anchored by abundant global supplies. The USDA raised its forecast for U.S. 2025/26 wheat ending stocks, bucking trade expectations for a cut. The government attributed the higher wheat stocks forecast to a reduction in demand from domestic flour millers. ADVERTISEMENT For corn, the USDA raised its estimate of U.S. 2025/26 exports by 100 million bushels and cut its forecast of corn ending stocks by the same amount. In Western Europe, France’s agriculture ministry raised its 2026 sowing estimate for the country’s main wheat crop slightly, confirming its expectation of an expanded area compared with last year. -Additional reporting by Ella Cao and Lewis Jackson in Beijing and Gus Trompiz in Paris ",N/A,"Markets,reuters"

But the prospect of China buying additional U.S. soy cargoes under a trade truce has buoyed the futures market. “The big unknown with China continues to be the big factor. We are finding that futures are just not able to set back very much in this environment,” said Terry Linn, analyst with Linn & Associates in Chicago. Wheat climbed despite a lack of news. Commodity funds hold a hefty net short position in CBOT wheat futures, leaving the market vulnerable to bouts of short-covering. Corn futures drifted lower, losing to soybeans and wheat on inter-market spreads.

However, the discrepancy is narrowing for April delivery. “Elevators are paying C$5.70 (per bushel for feed barley) delivered in the Edmonton region, and when you take the feed barley price picked up in the Lethbridge region, it would only be C$5.10, C$5.15 in the March timeframe picked up in the yard,” Leclerc explained.
