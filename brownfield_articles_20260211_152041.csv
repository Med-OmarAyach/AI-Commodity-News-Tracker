The USDA made no changes to U.S. ending stocks, while raising production for Brazil to 180 million tons, still just short of some major private projections. Quality is a concern in some areas because of heavy rain during harvest activity. CONAB’s updated estimate for Brazil is out Thursday. The USDA’s guess for Paraguay was also hiked modestly, up a half a million tons to 11.5 million. The trade’s watching that harvest in Brazil, along with rain chances for Argentina, while waiting for some fresh demand news from China. The USDA left 2025/26 imports by China at 112 million tons. Soybean meal and oil futures followed beans higher. There were no changes to the domestic balance sheets for soybean products either.Corn was steady to firm. U.S. corn ending stocks were down on the month due to higher exports, with no adjustments to production or exports for South America. That rise in U.S. exports was at least somewhat expected and the 2025/26 carryout projections remains above 2.1 billion bushels. If there was a surprise, it’s the USDA not lowering domestic feed use due to tight livestock supplies. The world balance sheet changes were minor, an increase for European Union production and a decrease for imports against a smaller crop for Mexico and higher imports. Ukraine’s corn export guess was lowered slightly. Corn is monitoring development conditions in Argentina, in addition to the first crop harvest and second crop planting paces in Brazil. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s weekly ethanol numbers are out Wednesday.The wheat complex was mixed. U.S. wheat ending stocks were modestly higher, rising 5 million bushels to 931 million on a cut in food use, while world stocks and production were lower, but exports were up. On the production side of things, the USDA raised estimates for Argentina and the United Kingdom, but not enough to cancel out a slight drop from other, unlisted nations. For exports, there were upward adjustments for Argentina and Canada, offsetting a cut for the European Union. The USDA’s next round of supply and demand estimates is out March 10th. Winter wheat growing areas are warming up, which could kickstart dormancy and leave crops vulnerable to another cold snap, with more widespread precipitation in the forecast for parts of the Plains later this month. The trade is also monitoring overwintering weather in Europe, Russia, and Ukraine. France’s AgriMer says soft winter wheat planted area was up on the year, noting favorable growing conditions.",2572

There’s more rain in the forecast for Argentina, while Brazil’s record harvest continues to move forward. There are concerns about the impact of excessively wet weather in parts of Brazil during harvest on quality. CONAB’s updated outlook at Brazil is set for this Thursday. Safras e Mercado says 33.9% of Brazil’s 2025/26 crop has been marketed, slower than the previous marketing year. China did buy 264,000 tons of 2025/26 U.S. beans ahead of the open, but it remains to be seen if that was a part of the trade deal framework reached last year or if it was sparked by last week’s social media comments by President Trump. U.S. soybean export inspections were below last week, but above last year, primarily to China and Egypt. The 2025/26 pace continues to trail 2024/25. Soybean meal futures were lower and soybean oil was higher on aggressive product spread trade.Corn was mostly lower. Corn is monitoring the rain in Argentina, along with first crop harvest and second crop planting in Brazil. Some of the production guesses have been lowered for Argentina and Brazil’s combined corn crop will be smaller than last year, but it looks like South American corn production in total will be large. The USDA’s supply and demand numbers are out Tuesday, with some expecting a cut in domestic feed use because of tight livestock supplies. Corn demand might be solid, but that big U.S. supply will continue to loom over the market. U.S. export inspections were up on the week, down on the year, with Mexico and Japan topping the ledger. Even with a slowdown, the pace this marketing year is still ahead of last marketing ear. APK-Inform lowered its 2025/26 corn export estimate for Ukraine 2 million tons to 23.5 million.The wheat complex was mixed. The USDA might make minimal changes to U.S. and world wheat numbers in Tuesday’s report, out at Noon Eastern/11 Central. Ongoing drought in the Plains could impact U.S. winter wheat development, with the trade also monitoring overwintering conditions in Europe, Russia, and Ukraine. APK-Inform now has 2025/26 wheat exports for Ukraine at 14.5 million tons, a drop from the last guess of 16.7 million tons. Stateside, there’s some scattered near-term rain in the forecast for parts of the Plains. The most recent round of negotiations aimed at ending Russia’s war on Ukraine had very little public progress. U.S. export inspections were up from the previous week and a year ago, with the Philippines and Bangladesh leading the way. Statistics Canada says wheat stocks at the end of December 2025 were above December 2024 levels.",2597

The trade is waiting for more details on the talk that China will be back in the market for a large amount of U.S. soybeans this marketing year. Outside of a social media post Wednesday though, there are a lot of unknowns. Brazil has a significant price advantage over the U.S. and Chinese storage capacity as it currently stands would reportedly be inadequate to take in another 8 million tons of U.S. beans. President Trump and President Xi are expected to meet face-to-face in April. Trade data shows Brazil’s January soybean exports at 1.878 million tons, up sharply on the year. ANEC sees Brazil’s February soybean exports at 11.42 million tons. There was more rain in the near-term forecast for dry sections of Argentina and southern Brazil. However, that rain might also extend into other areas of Brazil that have already seen some heavy rain during harvest, which has led to quality concerns. Soybean meal futures were mixed, adjusting spreads, and bean oil was lower on profit taking.Corn was lower on profit taking and technical selling but did end the week with modest gains. Corn is monitoring conditions in South America, especially rain chances in Argentina, along with the first crop harvest and second crop planting paces in Brazil. The USDA’s updated supply and demand numbers are out Tuesday the 10thand CONAB’s next outlook for Brazil is set for Thursday the 12th. Trade data from Brazil puts January corn exports at 4.247 million tons, a big increase from last year. ANEC projects February corn exports for Brazil at 793,364 tons. Corn is still looking at generally solid demand, but there are some caveats, including tight livestock numbers potentially lowering feed use and increasing export competition. On the fuel side of things, there have been reports of less expensive sorghum being used in ethanol production and the biofuel industry continues to push for year-round E15 availability. In any event, that generally solid demand is also blunted by a large available domestic supply.The wheat complex was lower on fund and technical selling, adding to what would have already been a week-to-week decline. U.S. wheat is at a price disadvantage on the export market and world supplies are rising. The dollar was down Friday, but has seen a recent rally, pushing the price of U.S. goods higher on the global market and further limiting the ability for U.S. supplies to compete for export business. Drought and dry conditions are concerns in large parts of the U.S. Plains, with the trade also monitoring overwintering weather in Europe, Russia, and Ukraine. Russia’s Ag Ministry says 97% of Russia’s winter crops are in “normal” condition, compared to 87% this time last year.",2788
