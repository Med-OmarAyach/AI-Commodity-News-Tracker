UK feed wheat futures (May-26)

Figure 1. UK feed wheat futures prices, May-26 contract

May-26 UK feed wheat futures increased at the end of last week and closed slightly above the 20-day moving average. Despite coming under strong pressure again during the week, the nearest support level of £167/t is still in place. When analysing price trends, a ‘support level’ is seen as a level that it may be harder for prices to fall below.

The relative strength index (RSI) increased from 32 on 23 January to 43 on Friday, moving away from the oversold zone. The RSI currently does not indicate any potential price momentum.

Market drivers

May-26 UK feed wheat futures price increased by £1.05/t (0.6%) last week (23–30 January), following global market trends, to reach £168.45/t. Over the same period, Chicago wheat and Paris milling wheat futures (May-26) increased by 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively. Although domestic feed wheat futures were supported by global wheat futures, strong sterling limited the increases. On 27 January, sterling reached £1 = $1.3846, its highest level against the US dollar since September 2021 (LSEG). However, sterling eased at the end of the week.

The global wheat market was mainly supported by weather risks for winter crops in the USA and Ukraine. Recent weather in Ukraine has been extremely cold, and some regions have experienced low levels of snow cover or ice crusts on the snow, which could affect winter crop conditions.

Competition between the main wheat exporters (the USA, Canada, Argentina, the EU, Australia and the Black Sea region) remains strong, and the influence of currencies is once again apparent. The stronger euro against the US dollar, which reached its highest level since June 2021 on Tuesday, will make EU wheat less competitive than that of other exporters.

The EU Commission's monthly forecast increased EU common wheat ending stocks by 1.3 Mt to 13.0 Mt for the 2025/26 season, compared to December's figures. This is primarily due to a reduction in common wheat exports, which are now estimated at 29.5 Mt, down from 31.0 Mt.

SovEcon, an agricultural consultancy, updated its forecast for Russian wheat exports in the 2025/26 season, increasing it by 1.1 Mt to 45.7 Mt, due to the strong pace of shipments and higher-than-expected crop figures. SovEcon also set its initial forecast for wheat exports in the 2026/27 season at 39.6 Mt.

In the short term, the pace of maize exports from the USA and the weather in Argentina and Brazil are important factors to consider. More rain is needed to support maize crop development in parts of Argentina after below-normal rainfall in January.

Paris rapeseed futures in £/t (May-26)

Figure 2. Paris rapeseed futures prices, May-26 contract, in £/tonne

May-26 Paris rapeseed futures in £/t fell 1.1% last week, to £409.50/t, a bigger fall than in euros due to stronger sterling. However, the price held just above the 50-day moving average, which may act as a ‘support line’.

The relative strength index (RSI) remained on the edge of being overbought, moving from 70 to 69 Friday-Friday.

Market drivers

Paris rapeseed futures prices ended last week lower after notable falls at the end of the week. The May-26 contract ended the week 0.8% lower at €472.75/t, while the Nov-26 contract fell 1.2% to €458.75/t.

For most of the week, rapeseed prices were underpinned by higher crude oil prices, concerns about dry weather in Argentina and increased Canadian canola (rapeseed) exports. But the stronger euro, which reached a four and a half year high of US$1.2041 on Tuesday (LSEG), prevented larger gains.

However, the US dollar mostly recovered on Friday after the US President nominated Kevin Warsh to be the next head of the US central bank. This recovery sparked a sell-off in metal, stock and wider commodity markets, which pulled oilseed prices down. The euro ended the week up 0.2% at $1.1850 (LSEG).

Nearby Brent crude oil futures reached a six-month high of $70.71/barrel on Thursday, largely due to concerns over the rising US-Iran tensions. The nearby price eased slightly on Friday to end the week at $70.69/barrel.

The potential impact of dry weather on soyabean crops in Argentina was also in focus. The Rosario Stock Exchange reports that core growing areas received under 35% of normal rainfall in January, with the most advanced crops beginning seed fill. The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange states that more rain is needed to support yield potential.

Reports that China has bought up to 650 Kt of Canadian canola were positive for prices, though doubt about how much can be shipped in this marketing season limited the market. Data due this Friday on Canadian stocks could give more insight into the export challenge.

Expana increased its forecast for the 2026 EU rapeseed crop on Friday by 0.1 Mt to 20.9 Mt, compared to 20.5 Mt in 2025. However, further deep frosts are forecast in Ukraine this week, which poses a risk to any rapeseed crops without adequate snow cover. This keeps uncertainty over the new crop picture.

UK feed wheat futures (May-26)

Figure 1. UK feed wheat futures prices, May-26 contract

May-26 UK feed wheat futures closed below the 20-day moving average at the end of last week.

Despite coming under pressure during the week, the nearest support level of £167/t is still in place, with the contract testing the £167/t support level, but didn’t close below this level.

The relative strength index (RSI) decreased from 43 on 30 January to 42 on Friday, moving back towards the oversold zone. The RSI currently does not indicate any notable price momentum.

Market drivers

May-26 UK feed wheat futures reversed the marginal gains from the week prior and closed at £167.30/t on Friday, down £1.15/t across the week (30 January to 06 February).

The domestic market shadowed the pressure on both Paris milling and Chicago wheat futures (May-26), which were both down 1.3% across the week.

Grain markets have marginally subsided across the week from the drop in crude oil prices and assessments over the recent cold weather snaps in both the USA and Black Sea.

Global grain markets remained focused on weather risks to winter crops in key producing regions, particularly in the USA and the Black Sea.

In the US Plains and parts of the Midwest, periods of cold weather and variable snow cover have maintained concerns over potential winterkill.

In Ukraine and southern Russia, episodes of low temperatures combined with patchy snow cover and ice crusts on existing snow continued to pose a threat to crop condition.

However, it was reported last week by Ukrainian state weather that the January weather conditions did not have considerable adverse impact on winter crops, despite the severe frost experienced.

Further to that, Russia’s deputy Prime Minister stated that Russian grain crops were in good condition, with data to suggest this (LSEG).

As of 05 February, 97% of grain crops were in a normal condition vs 87% for the same period in 2025.

The recent cold snap reported in Germany and Poland is providing some slight underpinning to European prices. However, global export competition among major wheat exporters remains intense, with the weakening of the euro against the US dollar across the week helping Europe’s competitiveness.

Another critical watchpoint for the grain market is that Argentina requires further rains over the next few weeks for their recently planted maize crop, especially in eastern parts of the country, to avoid major yield losses (Buenos Aires Grain Exchange).

The latest USDA World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates is scheduled to be released tomorrow at 17:00 GMT.

On a grain front, markets are not anticipating any major changes to 2025/26 global supply and demand, but if figures significantly deviate from expectations, we could see some movement in grain markets.

Paris rapeseed futures in £/t (May-26)

Figure 2. Paris rapeseed futures prices, May-26 contract, in £/tonne

May-26 Paris rapeseed futures in £/t gained 3.4% last week, to £423.32/t, a slightly bigger increase than in euros due to sterling decreasing against the euro.

As a result of this movement, prices approached the nearest resistance level of £425.00/t.

The relative strength index (RSI) remained on the edge of being overbought, moving from 69 to 70 Friday–Friday.

Market drivers

Paris rapeseed futures prices ended last week higher, supported by notable gains in soyabean futures.

The May-26 contract ended the week 3.2% higher at €487.75/t, while the Nov-26 contract gained 2.6% to €470.50/t.

Chicago soyabean futures and Winnipeg canola futures (May-26) increased by 4.8% and 1.8%, respectively.

Last week, the Chicago futures price rallied after President Trump implied that China would purchase an additional 8 Mt of US soyabeans in the current season. This is on top of the approximately 12 Mt that have already been booked since the agreement was reached in late October.

There was also some support for the vegetable oil complex from a proposed rule announced by the US Department of the Treasury, which governs how biofuel makers can access a tax credit for low-carbon transport fuels.

On the other hand, StoneX's latest forecast revealed that Brazil's soybean production is projected to reach 181.6 Mt in the 2025/26 season, a 2.3% increase from its figures in January.

Meanwhile, the consultancy firm Patria AgroNegocios reports that Brazilian farmers had harvested 16.6% of the area planted for the 2025/26 season by Friday, surpassing the 9.8% harvested at the same time last year (LSEG).

According to Safras & Mercado, Brazil's 2025/26 soyabean sales equate to 34.9% of the expected output, compared to 42.4% at the same time last year.

Canadian canola stocks totalled 15.6 Mt on 31 December, up 18.1% from a year earlier, according to StatsCan figures. This could put pressure on Winnipeg canola futures.

The agricultural consultancy APK-Inform has revised its forecast for Ukraine's 2026 rapeseed harvest downwards to 3.73 Mt, from a previous estimate of 3.88 Mt. The firm has also reduced its outlook for Ukraine's rapeseed exports for the 2026/27 season (July–June) to 2.70 Mt, from 2.96 Mt.

However, it is difficult to estimate the impact of the recent extremely low temperatures in Ukraine on the development of the winter rapeseed crop.

Attention is now turning to the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report from the USDA due on Tuesday (10 February).

Ahead of the report, the consensus among global analysts is that 2025/26 global soyabean stocks will be increased marginally, but US stocks will be slightly lowered.

Other key areas to watch are soyabean production in Brazil and Argentina.
